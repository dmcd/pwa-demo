# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

Todo.create(title: "Buy food: milk, bread, fruits", done: false)
Todo.create(title: "Imagine Dragons tickets", done: false)
